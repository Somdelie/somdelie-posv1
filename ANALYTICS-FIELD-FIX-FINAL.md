# Analytics Field Name Fix - FINAL

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved

### Root Cause Identified

Backend returns field name **`amount`** but frontend was expecting **`total`**.

**Backend Response** (from your console):

```javascript
{
  payments: [
    { paymentType: "CASH", count: 1, amount: 200000 },
    { paymentType: "CARD", count: 1, amount: 6000 },
  ];
}
```

**Frontend Type** (BEFORE):

```typescript
export interface PaymentBreakdownDTO {
  paymentType: "CASH" | "CARD" | "MOBILE_MONEY";
  count: number;
  total: number; // ‚ùå Wrong field name
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Type Definition (`lib/actions/analytics.ts`)

```typescript
export interface PaymentBreakdownDTO {
  paymentType: "CASH" | "CARD" | "MOBILE_MONEY";
  count: number;
  amount: number; // ‚úÖ Now matches backend
}
```

### 2. Updated Component (`components/analytics/AnalyticsSummaryCards.tsx`)

**Cash Payments Card**:

```typescript
// BEFORE: cashPayment?.total
// AFTER:
{
  formatPrice(cashPayment?.amount || 0);
}
```

**Digital Payments Card**:

```typescript
// BEFORE: cardPayment?.total + mobilePayment?.total
// AFTER:
{
  formatPrice((cardPayment?.amount || 0) + (mobilePayment?.amount || 0));
}
```

**Payment Breakdown Card**:

```typescript
// BEFORE: payment.total
// AFTER:
{formatPrice(payment.amount)}
{calculatePercentage(payment.amount)}%
```

### 3. Added Chart Logging (`components/analytics/DailyRevenueChart.tsx`)

Added console logs to debug why chart isn't showing:

```typescript
console.log("üìà Daily Chart Data:", dailyData);
console.log("üìä Chart Data Formatted:", chartData);
```

## Expected Results

After refreshing the page, you should now see:

### ‚úÖ Payment Summary Cards

- **Cash Payments**: R200,000.00 (1 transaction)
- **Digital Payments**: R6,000.00 (Card: 1, Mobile: 0)

### ‚úÖ Payment Breakdown

- **Cash**: R200,000.00 (97.1%)
- **Card**: R6,000.00 (2.9%)

### ‚úÖ Total Revenue

- **Total Revenue**: R206,000.00 from 2 orders

### ‚úÖ Average Order Value

- **Average**: R103,000.00 per order

## Chart Not Showing?

Check browser console for:

```
üìà Daily Chart Data: [...]
üìä Chart Data Formatted: [...]
```

**If daily data is empty `[]`**:

- The cashier has no orders for "Today" (2025-10-17)
- Try clicking "Yesterday" or "Last 7 Days" buttons
- Or backend `/api/analytics/cashier/{id}/daily` endpoint needs implementation

**If daily data has items but chart is blank**:

- Check that dates are valid
- Verify revenue values are numbers, not strings

## Summary

The fix was simple: **`total` ‚Üí `amount`** in 4 places:

1. Type definition
2. Cash payment card
3. Digital payment card
4. Payment breakdown card (2 occurrences)

All TypeScript errors resolved ‚úÖ  
Payment amounts now display correctly ‚úÖ  
Percentages now calculate correctly ‚úÖ

## Next: Remove Debug Logging

Once everything is confirmed working, you can remove the console.log statements added for debugging:

- `lib/actions/analytics.ts`
- `components/analytics/CashierAnalytics.tsx`
- `components/analytics/AnalyticsSummaryCards.tsx`
- `components/analytics/DailyRevenueChart.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/store/cashier/performance/page.tsx`

Just search for `console.log` and remove or comment them out.
