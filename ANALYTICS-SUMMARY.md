# Analytics Implementation - Quick Reference

## What Was Built

A complete role-based analytics system integrated into all dashboard pages using the backend analytics endpoints.

## Files Created

### Server Actions

- `lib/actions/analytics.ts` - All analytics API calls with JWT authentication

### Reusable Components

- `components/analytics/AnalyticsSummaryCards.tsx` - Revenue, orders, payment summary cards
- `components/analytics/DailyRevenueChart.tsx` - Daily revenue bar chart using recharts
- `components/analytics/DateRangeSelector.tsx` - Quick date range presets (Today, Week, Month, Year)

### Role-Specific Components

- `components/analytics/StoreAnalytics.tsx` - Store-level analytics (Store Admin, Store Manager)
- `components/analytics/BranchAnalytics.tsx` - Branch-level analytics (Branch Manager)
- `components/analytics/CashierAnalytics.tsx` - Cashier-level analytics (Cashiers)

### Pages Updated/Created

1. **Super Admin Dashboard** (`app/(dashboard)/super-admin/dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - Converted to client component
   - Shows global analytics across all stores
2. **Store Admin Dashboard** (`app/(dashboard)/store/admin/page.tsx`)
   - Added analytics section at bottom
   - Shows store-specific analytics
3. **Store Manager Dashboard** (`app/(dashboard)/store-manager/page.tsx`)
   - Converted from placeholder to functional analytics dashboard
   - Shows store-specific analytics
4. **Branch Manager Dashboard** (`app/(dashboard)/branch-manager/page.tsx`)
   - Added analytics section after branch info
   - Shows branch-specific analytics
5. **Cashier Performance Page** (`app/(dashboard)/store/cashier/performance/page.tsx`)
   - NEW PAGE: Personal performance analytics for cashiers
   - Added to sidebar menu as "My Performance"

### Navigation Updates

- `components/common/DashboardSidebar.tsx`
  - Added `TrendingUp` icon import
  - Added "My Performance" menu item for both cashier roles

### Documentation

- `ANALYTICS-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive implementation guide

## Analytics Features by Role

### üõ°Ô∏è Super Admin

- **Scope**: All stores globally
- **Endpoints**: `/api/analytics/global/summary`, `/api/analytics/global/daily`
- **Dashboard**: `/super-admin/dashboard`

### üè™ Store Admin

- **Scope**: Their store
- **Endpoints**: `/api/analytics/store/{storeId}/summary`, `/api/analytics/store/{storeId}/daily`
- **Dashboard**: `/store/admin` (analytics section added)

### üè¢ Store Manager

- **Scope**: Their store
- **Endpoints**: `/api/analytics/store/{storeId}/summary`, `/api/analytics/store/{storeId}/daily`
- **Dashboard**: `/store-manager`

### üèõÔ∏è Branch Manager

- **Scope**: Their branch
- **Endpoints**: `/api/analytics/branch/{branchId}/summary`, `/api/analytics/branch/{branchId}/daily`
- **Dashboard**: `/branch-manager` (analytics section added)

### üí∞ Cashier

- **Scope**: Personal performance
- **Endpoints**: `/api/analytics/cashier/{cashierId}/summary`, `/api/analytics/cashier/{cashierId}/daily`
- **Dashboard**: `/store/cashier/performance` (new page)

## What Each Dashboard Shows

### Summary Cards (4 cards in a grid)

1. **Total Revenue**: Total sales with order count
2. **Total Orders**: Order count with average order value
3. **Cash Payments**: Cash payment total with transaction count
4. **Digital Payments**: Card + Mobile Money combined with transaction counts

### Daily Revenue Chart

- Bar chart showing revenue per day
- X-axis: Dates (formatted as "Jan 1", "Jan 2", etc.)
- Y-axis: Revenue (formatted as currency)
- Tooltip shows exact values

### Payment Breakdown Card

- Cash payments (green icon)
- Card payments (blue icon)
- Mobile Money payments (purple icon)
- Shows count, total, and percentage for each

### Date Range Selector

Quick presets:

- **Today**: Current day only
- **Yesterday**: Previous day
- **Last 7 Days**: Rolling 7-day window
- **Last 30 Days**: Rolling 30-day window
- **This Year**: January 1 to today

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

1. User selects date range ‚Üí State update
2. Component calls server action with dates
3. Server action formats dates (YYYY-MM-DD) and adds JWT
4. Backend returns `AnalyticsSummaryDTO` and `DailyTotalDTO[]`
5. Components render data with proper formatting

### Date Format Conversion

- **Frontend Input**: JavaScript `Date` objects
- **API Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD` strings (LocalDate)
- **Display Format**: Localized strings (e.g., "Jan 15")

### Authentication

- All API calls use `getJWT()` from server-side cookies
- JWT attached as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

### Error Handling

- Loading states with skeleton loaders
- Graceful fallback to empty states
- Console error logging for debugging

## UI Components Used

- `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle` - Layout containers
- `Badge` - Payment type labels
- `Button` - Date range selector buttons
- `Skeleton` - Loading placeholders
- Recharts `BarChart`, `Bar`, `XAxis`, `YAxis`, `Tooltip`, `Legend` - Charts
- Lucide icons: `DollarSign`, `ShoppingCart`, `Banknote`, `CreditCard`, `Smartphone`, etc.

## No Breaking Changes

- All existing functionality preserved
- Store Admin page still shows store info, analytics added below
- Branch Manager page still shows branch/employee info, analytics added below
- Cashier Summary page unchanged (shift-based dashboard)
- New "My Performance" page is additive

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test each role's dashboard** to ensure correct data scope
2. **Test date range selector** with different presets
3. **Test with empty data** to verify fallback states
4. **Test loading states** by throttling network
5. **Test responsive design** on mobile/tablet/desktop
6. **Verify JWT authentication** works for all endpoints
7. **Check chart rendering** with various data ranges

## Next Steps

Once backend is confirmed working:

1. Test Super Admin global analytics
2. Test Store Admin/Manager with real store data
3. Test Branch Manager with real branch data
4. Test Cashier performance with real cashier orders
5. Verify payment breakdown calculations are accurate
6. Check daily chart handles date ranges correctly
7. Ensure currency formatting displays correctly

## Quick Start

1. **Backend must be running** at `http://localhost:5000` (or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`)
2. **Login as any role** and navigate to their dashboard
3. **Analytics will auto-load** for "Today" by default
4. **Click date range buttons** to see different periods
5. **Cashiers**: Click "My Performance" in sidebar to see personal analytics

## Summary

‚úÖ Complete analytics system implemented for all roles  
‚úÖ Reusable components for consistent UI/UX  
‚úÖ Role-based data scoping (Super Admin ‚Üí Cashier)  
‚úÖ Date range filtering with presets  
‚úÖ Charts and visualizations with recharts  
‚úÖ JWT authentication on all endpoints  
‚úÖ Error handling and loading states  
‚úÖ Mobile responsive design  
‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing features
